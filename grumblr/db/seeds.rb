# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# grumblrs = Grumblr.create([
#   {body: "This song is not bad.  Not great, but okay.", author: "DJ"},
#   {body: "Why can't I just relax and watch TV?", author: "Tina"},
#   {body: "It's not fair.", author: "John"},
#   {body: "My feet hurt!", author: "Greg"}
